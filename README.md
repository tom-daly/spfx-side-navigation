This project is no longer actively supported. Feel free to use this as an example but at this point I've moved on to new projects that require most of my time. 

# Introduction
This project is an SPFx application customizer built for Modern SharePoint sites / pages. It will place itself in the header placeholder of your site and pull navigation items from the list contained within the site. It could be a global navigation if you replace provider -- check out this project [https://github.com/tom-daly/spfx-global-navigation]

Rebuilt fresh on SPFx v1.4 so that it will support:

Environments
+ Office 365
+ SharePoint 2019 

Browers
+ IE 11
+ Chrome
+ FireFox

## Why does this project exist? 
This is just an interesting example of a side navigation that would be useful on Modern Communication sites as they don't have a left navigation. Inspiration taken from the Office 365 Admin Portal Left Navigation.

## Modern Page Demonstration
Designed for Modern Sites

# Prerequisites to Build
1. [SPFx Development Environment](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/set-up-your-development-environment)
2. [Tenant App Catalog](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/set-up-your-developer-tenant#create-app-catalog-site)
4. Node 8.x.x or 10.x.x

# Installation & Deployment
The following steps assume that you've cloned this repository or downloaded the files and successfully installed all the dependencies using 'npm install'. Make sure to use the same version of node to get a successfull build. 

## Overview
1. Build the SPFx Application Customizer
2. Deploy the SPFx Application Customizer
3. Add the App to your site

## Step 1 - Build the Solution
It is recommended to run the 'build.cmd' file from the projects root folder. This file does all the normal SPFx build commands such as build, bundle, package-solution but it will also generate the necessary file needed for support on classic sites. The 'build.cmd' also does a number of other things out of scope for guide. Please refer to the following blogs posts for more information on this file.

+ [SPFx Automatically Generating Revision Numbers](https://thomasdaly.net/2018/08/12/spfx-automatically-generating-revision-numbers/)

# Modifications

## Updating the Styles + Changing Colors
The project was written with a global sass stylesheet for Modern sites first and was then extended to support Classic sites. It should be simple enough to update the hex colors and rebuild to match your site's palette. 

+ site-menu.scss - Contains all the styles for the menu for both Classic and Modern sites. This file contains sass variables to easily update the colors of the menus to match your environment. All the other sass should not be adjusted as it controls the function of the menu.

# How To Use
It's super easy to use, once activated just add items to the list.

## Side Nav List
In Site Contents you'll see a new list called "Side Nav List" just add new list items.

The current implementation supports ANY SVG icon as long as its one color and you can provide the list item the SVG code. This way we can recolor with CSS and it will seamless fit into the 
navigation.
